# Sources
Within these folders are the sources for the self developed programs used within the pipelin.
Since I do not use GitHub as a source control system (I'm not a fan) but only uses it for distribution to the external world (you guys :) ) <br/>
I will not actively develop in it, but will upload newer versions of the files if needed.

Furthermore since I use Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code) as my primary IDE. I do not have any CMAKE files in the sources but .sln (solution)files.
I do develop in Windows,Mac,UNIX and VS code is for me simply not flexible enough, so I will not make that change in the near future (sorry guys ;) )

I will look in the near future for an option to make CMAKE files based on the .sln files alone and if so will add them in their sources as well.
