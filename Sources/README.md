# Sources
Within these folders are the sources for the self-developed programs I used within the pipeline.<br/>
Since I do not use GitHub as a source control system (I'm not a fan) but only use it for distribution to the external world (you guys :) ) <br/>
I will not actively develop it but will upload newer versions of the files if needed.

Since I develop in Visual Studio as my primary IDE (I develop in Windows, Mac, and Unix), VS Code does not give me the flexibility (by default). I've not added any CMAKE files (Visual Studio works with .sln files). I plan to add these in the future. 
However, if you have problems compiling one of the programs, and none of the other Linux-based executables work. <br/><br/>
Please feel free to contact me at:
maaikejacobine.bierenbroodspot@uni-goettingen.de
<br/>
And I will add your UNIX system to the list of executables.

Furthermore, I've used the [**boost**](https://www.boost.org/) Library (v1.78) in every project, so you should install this as well on your unix system if you want to compile it. <br/>
I'm convinced you can use the newest version since C++ is 99% of the time backward compatible (Unlike Python and R :') )
