# OrthoFinder
For the 9th step we have to run OrthoFinder to get all the orthogroups from the complete dataset.
Keep in mind that besides your samples, you should also add enough outgroups.
For a better result we have added a tree file as a guidance (See [Complete_Klebsotree.txt](Scripts/9_OrthoFinder/Complete_Klebsotree.txt) )

I've used my collogue's (Armin Dadras) as a guide to install OrthoFinder on an HPC cluster (but can also be done on a high performance machine)

Afterwards simply edit the file [Orthofinder.sh](Scripts/9_OrthoFinder/Orthofinder.sh) and run it
