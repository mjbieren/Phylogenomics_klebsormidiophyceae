# Trinity
This is the second step within the pipeline. Generally you just have to edit [Trinity_HPC.sh](Scripts/2_Trinity/Trinity_HPC.sh) if you run Trinity in a slurm system. <br/>
Alternatively you can also install Trinity within a conda environment.


For more information go to the [Trinity Github](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq) <br/>
I highly recommend to read into their [Wiki site](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki) that explains everything pretty well.
