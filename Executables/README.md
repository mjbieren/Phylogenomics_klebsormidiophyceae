# Exectubles
Within these folders I've already pre-compiled executables ready to be used.

I've compiled for 3 different systems:
```
Debian 10 (works also on 11)
Scientific Linux 7 (Red Hat Based)
Arch (Beta)
```

If you have difficulties compiling the software yourself, please feel free to contact me under maaikejacobine.bierenbroodspot@uni-goettingen.de 
and I will create a compiled version for your UNIX system of choice
